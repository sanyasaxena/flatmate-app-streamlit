# Flatmate Recommendation System
Flatmate Recommendation System: A Streamlit-based web app that helps users find compatible flatmates based on preferences like age, occupation, tidiness, lifestyle, and locality. The app uses a ML model (KNN with TF-IDF) to match users based on both user preferences and locality.
